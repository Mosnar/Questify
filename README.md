Questify
========
This was my submission for the Heyo 2014 24hr Hackathon. The goal was:
Create an innovative piece of software that will help businesses grow customer engagement and/or sales using gamification.

This project was intended to be a platform for companies to be able to register and create challenges for customers in order to build brand recognition.
